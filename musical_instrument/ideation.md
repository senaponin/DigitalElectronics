#HW - 3 
### 1. Draw a sketch of your instrument

### 2. Describe the overall concept

From day one, I've always want to improve the graduate studio space at CCA. I believe that wanting to put as much interactive experience in the vicinity will inspire others to do the same. It will also promote discussion, sharing of ideas and the overall excitement around the area. It is not enough to just go to your graduate studio space and do work; it needs to be a space of inspiration.

With that in mind, I want to create a musical instrument out of the stairs in our studio. There are three modes of entry and they are all staircases - this will force the graduate students to interact with the musical instrument.

It will involve an analog pressure sensor for each step that relays to different sounds when triggered. Depending on how heavy or light the applied pressure will create different sounds. For example, a heavier stomp = lower sounds.

### 3. Create a very rough schematic to the best of your ability

### 4. Describe what your program will do, to the best of your ability
The program will build upon this system:

I will connect the pressure sensor/arduino into processing to draw forth musical notes and play it back for every time people stepped on the sensor. I have not yet fully researched the process however the reasoning to connect this arduino code to processing makes sense as I am interested in making sounds come out lower depending on pressure; it will be (to my knowledge) something I am familiar in using.
