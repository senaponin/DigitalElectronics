# Final Project 
This final project will be done by Nino Panes for the Spring '17 class of "Digital Electronics" at California College of the Arts.
For further inquiries on the project, please email me at npanes@cca.edu.

## Proposal
For this project, I wish to continue my work from last semester's Studio 1 class. In that class we created a mock up of a ring that helped a colorblind person see the shades of blue, green, yellow and red (etc.)that she/he would have not otherwise. This would be done using a color sensor that relays information to a vibrator that would act as a haptic feedback to notify the user that the color they wish to choose.

The perceived factors that make this project hard are as follows: 
### How to determine the exact color?
	Color sensors are hard to control with the input they are receiving. How do we calibrate for 
	the appropriate color?
### How to give visual cues that the right color is being detected? How does the user choose color?
	In my team's original idea, we used an app that connected to the ring via bluetooth so that 
	the user could see and choose. I would need to reiterate this interaction into a different model.
